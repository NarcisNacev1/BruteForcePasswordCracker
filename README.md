## BruteForcePasswordCracker

This is a simple password cracker that goes through multiple passwords until it guesses the correct one.

### What I Learned

- **First time using Bash:** It looks pretty simple and straightforward.
- **Reading files and using external commands:** I learned how to read a file from an external source and use the following command:
  ```bash
  python ImageTOASCII.py --file C:\Users\narci\PycharmProjects\imageToASCII\PIL\image.jpg --scale 0.5 --cols 100 --out ascii_art.txt --morelevels
  ```
- **Password cracking challenges:** I realized that cracking a password using brute force is extremely difficult. However, using lists with thousands of passwords might make it somewhat feasible, although still very challenging.
