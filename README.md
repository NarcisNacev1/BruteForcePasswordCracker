**BruteForcePasswordCracker**
-This is a simple password cracker that goes trough some passwords untill it guesses the right one

**What I Learned**
-First time using Bash looks pretty simple
-How to read a file from the outside and the command |python ImageTOASCII.py --file C:\Users\narci\PycharmProjects\imageToASCII\PIL\image.jpg --scale 0.5 --cols 100 --out ascii_art.txt --morelevels |
-Realized its really hard to crack a password this way but there might be lists with thousands of passwords on them so maybe its possible but still hard
